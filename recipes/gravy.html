        Seriously though there's only two ingredients and they are brown and water... It's fast and easy and your guests will never return! Introverts best scenario.

    Like I said earlier all you'll need is two ingredients.
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Brown</li>
    </ul>

</p>
<p> You know what to do...
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ingredients over medium high heat</li>
        <li>Lick hot burner to ensure no tastebuds remain</li>
        <li>Seriously why are you taking advice from me?</li>

    </ol>
